🧩 Overview

Java applications often face “works on my machine” issues due to environment inconsistencies.
Docker solves this by packaging applications with their runtime, dependencies, and libraries inside lightweight containers.

This project shows how a Java application can be:

Built into a Docker image

Tested in an isolated container environment

Shared via Docker Hub for universal access

🎯 Project Objective

Learn containerization for Java applications

Ensure consistent deployments across environments

Simplify integration with CI/CD pipelines

Understand Docker architecture and image lifecycle

🏗️ Architecture

The containerization workflow has three stages:

1. Source Stage

Prepare Java project source files (Main.java, pom.xml)

Write a Dockerfile to define the base image and build process

2. Build Stage

Use Docker to build an image with a Java base (e.g., openjdk:11)

Compile and package the source code into a runnable .jar

3. Test & Deployment Stage

Run the application inside a container to verify functionality

Push the verified image to Docker Hub
