# 🐳 Containerization of Java Project using Docker

This project demonstrates how a **Java application** can be **containerized using Docker**, enabling it to run consistently across any environment — from local systems to production servers.  

It focuses on the **concept, architecture, and practical steps** of containerization.

## 🧩 Overview

Java applications often face **“works on my machine”** issues due to environment inconsistencies.  
Docker solves this by packaging applications with their **runtime, dependencies, and libraries** inside lightweight containers.

This project demonstrates how a Java application can be:

1. Built into a Docker image  
2. Tested in an isolated container environment  
3. Shared via **Docker Hub** for universal access  

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

- Learn **containerization** for Java applications  
- Ensure **consistent deployments** across environments  
- Simplify integration with **CI/CD pipelines**  
- Understand **Docker architecture and image lifecycle**  

---

## 🏗️ Architecture

The containerization workflow has three main stages:

### 🔹 1. Source Stage
- Prepare Java project source files (`Main.java`, `pom.xml`)  
- Write a **Dockerfile** to define the base image and build process  

### 🔹 2. Build Stage
- Use Docker to build an image with a Java base (e.g., `openjdk:11`)  
- Compile and package the source code into a runnable `.jar`  

### 🔹 3. Test & Deployment Stage
- Run the application inside a container to verify functionality  
- Push the verified image to **Docker Hub**

## 🧠 Technologies Used

| Tool / Technology     | Purpose                                   |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Java (OpenJDK 11)** | Application runtime and code execution    |
| **Docker**            | Platform for containerization             |
| **Dockerfile**        | Blueprint to build the image              |
| **Docker Compose**    | Orchestrates multi-container environments |
| **Docker Hub**        | Registry for hosting and sharing images   |

## 🧾 Outputs

After successful containerization, the following outputs were obtained:

| Stage          | Description                            | Result                     |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| **Source**     | Java project with Dockerfile prepared  | ✅ Ready for build          |
| **Build**      | Docker image created with Java app     | ✅ Portable image generated |
| **Test**       | App runs successfully inside container | ✅ Functional verification  |
| **Deployment** | Image uploaded to Docker Hub           | ✅ Globally accessible      |

## 💡 Key Takeaways

- Docker ensures **environment consistency** across development, testing, and production.  
- Java applications become **portable, reproducible, and scalable**.  
- Ideal for **DevOps CI/CD pipelines** and cloud-native development.  
- Simplifies **collaboration** by maintaining uniform environments for all team members.  
- Reduces onboarding time for new developers.  

---

## 🧱 Conclusion

This project successfully demonstrates the **containerization of a Java application using Docker**, highlighting how easily a traditional Java app can be packaged, shipped, and deployed in a consistent environment.  

By using Docker:
- The Java app becomes **platform-independent**.  
- Deployment time is significantly reduced.  
- The same container image can run across **development, staging, and production** environments without modification.  

This hands-on implementation forms a **foundation for integrating CI/CD tools** like Jenkins or GitHub Actions, enabling complete automation in future DevOps pipelines.
